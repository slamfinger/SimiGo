## Current snapshot

```text
branch = codex/execution-state-research-20260929
route = EXECUTION-STATE-CENTRIC
runtime line = SEALED / BOUNDED CONSOLIDATION
architecture contract = PHASE A REVIEW PASS / REGISTERED
PALACE-1 = BOUNDARY AUDIT PASS / REGISTERED
BACKEND-1 = SECONDARY OPEN / BOUNDARY PRECONDITION SATISFIED / ACTIVATION DECISION NEXT
oversized = FROZEN / ARCHITECTURE VALIDATION PAYLOAD
next mode = PHASE_C_BACKEND1_ACTIVATION_DECISION / NO_STORAGE_OR_ADAPTER_IMPLEMENTATION
```

2026-09-29 route redefinition:

- Runtime correctness evidence is no longer a main expansion line.
- Oversized independent research is frozen and retained only as validation payload.
- PALACE-1 and BACKEND-1 are no longer treated as two immediately parallel implementation tracks.
- A new Execution State Architecture Contract synthesis gate comes first.
- The next audit must classify current runtime state touches as Durable Semantic State (D),
  Runtime Binding (R), Physical Representation (P), Observability/History (O), or
  Transient/Reconstructable (T).
- Storage technology selection and Llama adapter implementation remain unauthorized.

2026-09-29 Phase A result:

- Audit completed for the current Lab runtime code only; no storage was selected.
- The inferred minimal D closure is the semantic `ExecutionStateHandle` aggregate:
  id, lineage, position, continuation, lifecycle.
- `RepresentationRef`, bindings, lifecycle history, artifact sidecars, pool stats,
  and physical-use state are not part of the minimal D closure.
- Durable Execution State and durable representation reattachment must remain
  separate boundary decisions.
- Targeted contract/pool/store/materialization/atomicity tests passed 45/45.

2026-09-30 external review:

- Verdict: `PASS / REGISTRATION_REQUIRED`.
- Review is not repository registration.
- Phase B remains closed until explicit human/repository registration.
- Six non-blocking conditions are registered for Phase B:
  durable identity allocation, continuation-vs-transcript equivalence,
  representation content claim, separate binding persistence boundary,
  crash-consistency semantics, and the discarded-binding gap.

2026-09-30 Phase B draft:

- A PALACE-1 minimal durable unit opening draft is now available.
- It is a participant proposal only.
- Phase B remains closed until the Phase A review decision is explicitly
  registered.

2026-09-30 Phase B draft review:

- Verdict: `PASS / ACTIVATION_REQUIRED`.
- The draft now includes interrupted fork / continue / restore recovery windows.
- Review is not activation; Phase B remains closed.
- One explicit human registration can approve both the Phase A PASS and the
  reviewed Phase B opening.

2026-09-30 explicit registration:

- Human instruction: `登记两项 PASS，并激活 Phase B opening。`
- Phase A review PASS is registered.
- Phase B draft review PASS is registered.
- The reviewed Phase B draft is activated as the PALACE-1 opening.
- Phase B is now open only for code-level architecture audit.

2026-09-30 Phase B audit:

- Audited clean HEAD `db188ac`; unrelated dirty Swift files in the main worktree
  were not mixed into evidence.
- Named the contract-level minimal durable unit `Execution Semantic Snapshot`.
- A recoverable set is the closure of snapshots plus required lineage tombstones.
- `continuation.nextInput` remains D in the current Lab contract.
- RepresentationRef and binding relations remain separate from minimum D.
- Full lifecycle records, pool stats, and in-flight work are not minimum D.
- Targeted clean-HEAD tests passed 57/57.

2026-09-30 Phase B audit review:

- Verdict: `PASS / REGISTRATION_REQUIRED`.
- Review is not repository registration.
- Phase C / BACKEND-1 remain gated until the Phase B boundary is registered.
- Six mandatory conditions carry forward: lineage tombstone closure,
  transcript equivalence proof, representation content claim, separately typed
  binding relation, crash-window classification, and concurrency/identity gaps.

2026-09-30 Phase B audit registration:

- Human instruction: `登记 Phase B audit PASS。`
- Registration artifact:
  `docs/00-governance/SIMIGO_LAB_PALACE1_PHASE_B_AUDIT_REGISTRATION_20260930.md`。
- Phase B boundary audit `PASS` is registered; minimal durable unit =
  `Execution Semantic Snapshot` is now the registered architecture contract.
- The six mandatory conditions are inherited by every later gate.
- Phase C / BACKEND-1 boundary precondition is SATISFIED; activation still
  requires its own decision point, and the BACKEND-1 opening must be re-reviewed
  against the registered boundary before execution.

`docs/00-governance/SIMIGO_LAB_EXECUTION_STATE_RESEARCH_ROUTE_REDEFINITION_20260929.md`

## Hard boundaries

```text
❌ 不实现 Palace database
❌ 不选定 SQLite / embedded KV / remote service等存储方案
❌ 不直接实现 Llama adapter
❌ 不重启 standalone oversized layer / tensor / loading strategy研究
❌ 不把 oversized scale latency解释为 performance benchmark
❌ 不为 oversized结果给 Execution State增加特殊语义
```

## Next session task

1. Decide the Phase C / BACKEND-1 activation question：是否现在激活 BACKEND-1
   opening 的对照审阅（先定义门，不是实现）。
2. BACKEND-1 opening 须对照已登记的 Phase B boundary（Execution Semantic
   Snapshot + recoverable set）重新审阅后，才可进入执行。
3. Do not select SQLite / KV / event log / remote storage。
4. 继续继承六个 mandatory conditions；不实现 Llama adapter。

登记时必须继续区分：

```text
observed code fact
≠ inferred storage design
≠ selected implementation
```
