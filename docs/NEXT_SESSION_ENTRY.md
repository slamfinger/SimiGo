# SimiGo-Lab Next Session Entry

登记时间：2026-09-30
状态：`PHASE_B_OPEN / CODE_LEVEL_AUDIT_NEXT`

本文件是新会话的快速入口，不替代 `docs/RESEARCH_STATE.md` 的权威状态。

## Recovery order

1. 检查 Git 状态与最近提交，不从旧会话记忆恢复。
2. 读 `docs/AGENT_CONTEXT.md` 的 source-of-truth、recovery、boundary规则。
3. 读 `docs/RESEARCH_STATE.md`；最新结论优先看文件尾部 2026-09-29 sections。
4. 读 `docs/00-governance/SIMIGO_LAB_OVERSIZED_RESEARCH_BOUNDARY_FREEZE_20260929.md`。
5. 读 Phase A 审计：
   - `docs/00-governance/SIMIGO_LAB_EXECUTION_STATE_PHASE_A_BOUNDARY_AUDIT_20260929.md`
6. 读 Phase A external review：
   - `docs/00-governance/SIMIGO_LAB_EXECUTION_STATE_PHASE_A_EXTERNAL_REVIEW_20260930.md`
7. 读 registered Phase B opening：
   - `docs/00-governance/SIMIGO_LAB_PALACE1_MINIMAL_DURABLE_UNIT_DRAFT_20260930.md`
8. 读 Phase B draft review：
   - `docs/00-governance/SIMIGO_LAB_PALACE1_PHASE_B_DRAFT_EXTERNAL_REVIEW_20260930.md`
9. 读 Phase B opening registration：
   - `docs/00-governance/SIMIGO_LAB_PALACE1_PHASE_B_OPENING_REGISTRATION_20260930.md`
10. 如需原始 opening，再读：
   - `docs/00-governance/SIMIGO18_PALACE1_EXECUTION_STATE_STORAGE_RESEARCH_OPENING_20260928.md`
   - `docs/00-governance/SIMIGO18_BACKEND1_LLAMA_RESEARCH_OPENING_20260928.md`

## Current snapshot

```text
branch = codex/execution-state-research-20260929
route = EXECUTION-STATE-CENTRIC
runtime line = SEALED / BOUNDED CONSOLIDATION
architecture contract = PHASE A REVIEW PASS / REGISTERED
PALACE-1 = OPEN / CODE_LEVEL_AUDIT_NEXT
BACKEND-1 = SECONDARY OPEN / DEPENDENT ON BOUNDARY
oversized = FROZEN / ARCHITECTURE VALIDATION PAYLOAD
next mode = PHASE_B_CODE_LEVEL_AUDIT / NO_STORAGE_OR_ADAPTER_IMPLEMENTATION
```

2026-09-29 route redefinition:

- Runtime correctness evidence is no longer a main expansion line.
- Oversized independent research is frozen and retained only as validation payload.
- PALACE-1 and BACKEND-1 are no longer treated as two immediately parallel implementation tracks.
- A new Execution State Architecture Contract synthesis gate comes first.
- The next audit must classify current runtime state touches as Durable Semantic State (D),
  Runtime Binding (R), Physical Representation (P), Observability/History (O), or
  Transient/Reconstructable (T).
- Storage technology selection and Llama adapter implementation remain unauthorized.

2026-09-29 Phase A result:

- Audit completed for the current Lab runtime code only; no storage was selected.
- The inferred minimal D closure is the semantic `ExecutionStateHandle` aggregate:
  id, lineage, position, continuation, lifecycle.
- `RepresentationRef`, bindings, lifecycle history, artifact sidecars, pool stats,
  and physical-use state are not part of the minimal D closure.
- Durable Execution State and durable representation reattachment must remain
  separate boundary decisions.
- Targeted contract/pool/store/materialization/atomicity tests passed 45/45.

2026-09-30 external review:

- Verdict: `PASS / REGISTRATION_REQUIRED`.
- Review is not repository registration.
- Phase B remains closed until explicit human/repository registration.
- Six non-blocking conditions are registered for Phase B:
  durable identity allocation, continuation-vs-transcript equivalence,
  representation content claim, separate binding persistence boundary,
  crash-consistency semantics, and the discarded-binding gap.

2026-09-30 Phase B draft:

- A PALACE-1 minimal durable unit opening draft is now available.
- It is a participant proposal only.
- Phase B remains closed until the Phase A review decision is explicitly
  registered.

2026-09-30 Phase B draft review:

- Verdict: `PASS / ACTIVATION_REQUIRED`.
- The draft now includes interrupted fork / continue / restore recovery windows.
- Review is not activation; Phase B remains closed.
- One explicit human registration can approve both the Phase A PASS and the
  reviewed Phase B opening.

2026-09-30 explicit registration:

- Human instruction: `登记两项 PASS，并激活 Phase B opening。`
- Phase A review PASS is registered.
- Phase B draft review PASS is registered.
- The reviewed Phase B draft is activated as the PALACE-1 opening.
- Phase B is now open only for code-level architecture audit.

## Hard boundaries

```text
❌ 不实现 Palace database
❌ 不选定 SQLite / embedded KV / remote service等存储方案
❌ 不直接实现 Llama adapter
❌ 不重启 standalone oversized layer / tensor / loading strategy研究
❌ 不把 oversized scale latency解释为 performance benchmark
❌ 不为 oversized结果给 Execution State增加特殊语义
```

## Next session task

1. Execute the registered Phase B code-level audit。
2. Answer the seven opening subquestions B1–B7 using current code evidence。
3. Keep the Phase A D/R/P/O/T boundary。
4. Do not select SQLite / KV / event log / remote storage。
5. BACKEND-1 remains separately scoped until the Phase B boundary is registered。

登记时必须继续区分：

```text
observed code fact
≠ inferred storage design
≠ selected implementation
```
