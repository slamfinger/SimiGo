## Progress

1. Path A made the current Information Place the default repository entry.
2. Phase 2 restricted default-entry recovery was accepted as a bounded pass.
   It did not prove fully isolated-agent reproducibility or actual continuation.
3. `IS-IDLOC-SEAM-01` separated `Information Identity`, `Representation
   Identity`, `Physical Locator`, and `Historical Pin`.
4. Existing-system review and Core mechanism audit concluded that mature
   substrate mechanisms can provide much of identity/revision/locator/history,
   while semantic identity, applicability, membership, availability meaning,
   lineage, and ES access remain SimiGo/higher-layer work.
5. `PICS-01` reduced database selection to:
   `responsibility → system class → integration seam → workload → protocol`.
6. Human accepted PICS-01 D1-D8 and CCS-C8 as `ACCEPTED / BOUNDED PASS / CLOSED`.
7. The registered PICS-01 gap is that performance was not a formal acceptance
   dimension. It is now mandatory in the successor study.
8. `CCVS-01` was opened only for design, candidate inventory, and validation
   protocol authoring.
9. CCVS-01 mandates a minimum-component baseline and forbids assuming that a
   multi-component architecture is superior.

## Next legal transition

```text
Complete CCVS-01 Phase A:
  candidate inventory,
  topology definitions,
  workload specification,
  performance metric specification,
  consistency/fault protocol,
  resource/safety limits,
  and shortlist criteria.

Then stop at Human review.
```

No benchmark may run until Phase B is separately approved. No backend may be
selected until the later selection gate. No code, adapter, schema DDL, migration,
or Lab reorganization is authorized.
