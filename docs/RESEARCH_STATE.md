### Current internal interfaces

```
P : PROJECTION_CANDIDATE
δ : DECISION_GENERATION_PARAMETER
θ : REGIME_PARAMETER

𝒢_adm(P) = ADMISSIBLE_DECISION_RULE_FAMILY
𝒢_adm(P) ⊆ {g | g : W → A}

L : Dom(L) → ℝ

R-INTERNAL-8 / E8-C:
(g,P,θ) ∈ Dom(L)
    ⇔
g ∈ 𝒢_adm(P)
    ∧
E_θ[C_LOSS(g(W),W)] 合法且为有限实数

R-INTERNAL-9 / E9-B:
R(P,θ)
=
OPT_{g ∈ 𝒢_adm(P),\,(g,P,θ)∈Dom(L)}
L(g;P,θ)

R-INTERNAL-10 / E10-B:
∃g :
g ∈ 𝒢_adm(P)
∧
(g,P,θ) ∈ Dom(L)

等价地：
{g ∈ 𝒢_adm(P) | (g,P,θ) ∈ Dom(L)} ≠ ∅

R-INTERNAL-11 / E11-B:
R(P,θ) ∈ ℝ

R-INTERNAL-12 / K3-A:
V(P,θ)
=
{L(g;P,θ) | g ∈ 𝒢_adm(P), (g,P,θ) ∈ Dom(L)}

OPT(P,θ) = inf V(P,θ)

R-INTERNAL-13 / K3-B:
V(P,θ) ≠ ∅ and V(P,θ) ⊆ ℝ.

Dom(R)
=
{(P,θ) | D_opt(P,θ) ≠ ∅ ∧ inf V(P,θ) ∈ ℝ}

R(P,θ) = inf V(P,θ) ∈ ℝ,  ((P,θ) ∈ Dom(R))

R-INTERNAL-14 / K4-A:
att : Dom(R) → {true, false}

att(P,θ) ⇔ inf V(P,θ) ∈ V(P,θ)

Dom_att
=
{(P,θ) ∈ Dom(R) | att(P,θ)}

R-INTERNAL-15 / K4-B:
Argmin(P,θ)
=
{g ∈ D_opt(P,θ) | L(g;P,θ) = inf V(P,θ)}
\quad ((P,θ) ∈ Dom(R))

Argmin(P,θ) ≠ ∅
⇔
att(P,θ)

Dom_att
=
{(P,θ) ∈ Dom(R) | Argmin(P,θ) ≠ ∅}

R-INTERNAL-16 / K4-C:
uniq : Dom(R) → {true, false}

uniq(P,θ) ⇔ |Argmin(P,θ)| = 1

Dom_uniq
=
{(P,θ) ∈ Dom(R) | uniq(P,θ)}
```

R-INTERNAL-14 defines the attainment predicate without asserting attainment. R-INTERNAL-15 defines the argmin set on Dom(R) and formally registers the pointwise equivalence between argmin non-emptiness and att. Neither gate asserts that attainment or argmin non-emptiness holds at any particular point.

### Assembly state

```
R-ASSEMBLY-1A = DECLARED (COMPOSITE_PROJECTION_RULE_PAIR)
R-ASSEMBLY-1B = DECLARED (JOINT_COMPOSITE_OUTPUT_MECHANISM)
R-ASSEMBLY-1C = DECLARED (C3)
R-ASSEMBLY-2  = DECLARED (D2)
R-ASSEMBLY-3  = DECLARED (F2)
R-ASSEMBLY-4  = DECLARED (G2)
R-ASSEMBLY-5  = DECLARED (H2)
R-ASSEMBLY-6  = DECLARED (I2)
R-ASSEMBLY-7  = DECLARED (J1)
R-ASSEMBLY-8  = DECLARED (K3)
R-ASSEMBLY-9  = DECLARED (L3)
R-ASSEMBLY-10 = DECLARED (M4)

R_OBJECT     = DECLARED (R : Dom(R) → ℝ)
R_ASSEMBLY   = CLOSED (M4 DEFERRAL SATISFIED)
R_ORACLE     = NOT_DEFINED
Δ            = BLOCKED
FinLoss      = NOT LEGALLY AVAILABLE
NECT         = BLOCKED
STEP⑤        = NOT ENTERED
STEP⑥        = NOT ENTERED
EXPERIMENT AUTH = NONE
HARNESS AUTH    = NONE
```

### Core aggregate construction

```
Γ(P,δ) = g
g : W → A

L(g;P,θ) = E_θ[C_LOSS(g(W),W)]

R(P,θ)
=
OPT_{g ∈ 𝒢_adm(P),\,(g,P,θ)∈Dom(L)}
L(g;P,θ)

R(P,θ) ∈ ℝ
```

OPT is concretized as a value-level infimum by R-INTERNAL-12. R-INTERNAL-13 establishes the finite-value applicability domain for that construction. R-INTERNAL-14 defines the attainment predicate without asserting attainment. The non-emptiness of `Dom(R)` and `Dom_att` itself is not declared.

### Research boundaries

R_OBJECT is declared as the value functional R : Dom(R) → ℝ; under RO-1, the research object is the optimal value, while Argmin / att / uniq and their domains remain auxiliary diagnostic/semantic objects and are not deleted. R_ORACLE remains undefined by the current framework. Δ remains blocked. FinLoss and NECT remain unavailable. Historical STEP⑤ formulation remains historical/conditional only. No STEP⑤/STEP⑥ entry, implementation, harness, data collection, profiling, measurement, or experiment authorization follows from R-INTERNAL-15.

R-INTERNAL-16 does not introduce topology or any structural condition, and does not pre-authorize future sufficient-condition families. It does not declare optimizer existence at any point, attainment at any point, minimum attainment, `min` reformulation, selector/tie-breaking, canonical choice, uniqueness at any particular point, compactness, continuity, measurability, finiteness/cardinality assumptions, any θ-level optimization, `A(P,θ)`, historical `δ(I_P)`, R_OBJECT, R_ORACLE, Δ, FinLoss, or NECT. The uniqueness predicate itself is defined, but no instance is asserted to satisfy it.

The authorized forward interface after R-INTERNAL-16 is:
```
att : Dom(R) → {true,false}
Argmin(P,θ) = {g ∈ D_opt(P,θ) | L(g;P,θ) = inf V(P,θ)}
Argmin(P,θ) ≠ ∅ ⇔ att(P,θ)
Dom_att = {(P,θ) ∈ Dom(R) | Argmin(P,θ) ≠ ∅}
uniq : Dom(R) → {true,false}
uniq(P,θ) ⇔ |Argmin(P,θ)| = 1
Dom_uniq = {(P,θ) ∈ Dom(R) | uniq(P,θ)}
```

The equivalence is registered as the formal bridge between attainment and argmin non-emptiness. R-INTERNAL-16 defines only the uniqueness predicate and its truth domain; it does not assert uniqueness anywhere. Selector/tie-breaking remains a separate layer.

Historical `δ(I_P)` is not restored and no new δ optimization domain is introduced.

R-INTERNAL-17 / RO-1 explicitly keeps `δ(I_P)` BLOCKED and does not introduce any new δ optimization domain. `Δ` remains BLOCKED; `FinLoss` remains NOT LEGALLY AVAILABLE; `NECT` remains BLOCKED. θ-level optimization and `A(P,θ)` remain excluded. No approximation/gap object is introduced.

R-INTERNAL-16 does not declare `Dom_uniq ≠ ∅`, does not assert `uniq` is true at any point, and does not create a selector from uniqueness. The observation that `uniq(P,θ)` is false whenever `Argmin(P,θ)=∅` is a direct consequence of the registered definitions, not a separate assertion.


### R-INTERNAL-18 / ROr-4 — R_ORACLE deferred

R-INTERNAL-18 = ROr-4 / DEFERRED

R_ORACLE : NOT_DEFINED

暂缓理由：
1. 无已登记消费者：Δ = BLOCKED，gap/D 未声明，STEP⑤ = NOT ENTERED。
2. 来源形态未决：P-free 可容许类 / 理论基准均未声明。
3. 历史公式 D(P;θ) = R(P;θ) − R_oracle(θ) 仅为历史内容，不被本面恢复。

合法重开条件（二选一，各自独立开面）：
- A. 出现已登记的参照值消费问题——且该比较面必须先论证其对 Δ BLOCKED 的合法绕行路径。
- B. 结构面声明 oracle 来源（P-free 类 / 理论基准及其定义域）。

本面产出是“暂缓”边界记录本身，不声明 R_ORACLE 对象接口。

R-INTERNAL-18 不引入：
- gap / D / suboptimality 的任何形式（含定义性占位）；
- 历史 δ(I_P)、新的 δ 优化域、A(P,θ)、θ 层优化；
- Δ、FinLoss、NECT；
- 任何 selector、tie-breaking、canonical optimizer、g*；
- topology、compactness、continuity、measurability、finiteness/cardinality assumptions；
- implementation、harness、data collection、profiling、measurement、experiment authorization。

Argmin / att / uniq 维持 RO-1 下辅助对象地位，不因本面变动。

R_ASSEMBLY = OPEN（门时点记录；已由 R-ASSEMBLY Transition Audit 关闭为 CLOSED）
R_OBJECT = DECLARED (R : Dom(R) → ℝ)
R_ORACLE = NOT_DEFINED
Δ = BLOCKED
FinLoss = NOT LEGALLY AVAILABLE
NECT = BLOCKED
STEP⑤ = NOT ENTERED
STEP⑥ = NOT ENTERED
EXPERIMENT AUTH = NONE
HARNESS AUTH = NONE


### R-INTERNAL-19 / A — Abstraction Layer Completeness Audit

R-INTERNAL-19 = A / ABSTRACTION_LAYER_COMPLETENESS_AUDIT

This is a boundary audit and declares no new semantic object.

Current finding:
- The current abstraction layer has no remaining purposeful, consumer-driven interface that can be legally registered without a structural declaration, concrete instantiation, or program-level problem surface.
- R-INTERNAL chain status = IDLE.
- IDLE means deliberate decision-resting / suspension, not mathematical deadlock or semantic failure.

Open predicates without asserted instances:
- att
- uniq

Remaining surfaces and prerequisites:
- selector / tie-breaking → structural declaration (e.g. order/topology) first;
- attainment sufficient conditions → structural declaration first;
- non-empty Dom(R) / Dom_att / Dom_uniq → concrete instantiation first;
- R_ORACLE → ROr-4 reopening conditions only;
- Δ / gap → comparison problem plus explicit legality argument;
- STEP⑤ / STEP⑥ → program-level decision.

Anti-drift objects considered but not declared because they have no registered consumer:
- gap := L(g) − inf V
- ε-argmin families
- cardinality refinements such as |Argmin| ≥ k
- sectional properties of R

No new R-INTERNAL gate is authorized merely to maintain chain momentum. Any future gate must be opened by at least one of:
a) a new program-level problem surface;
b) a consumer-driven structural declaration surface;
c) a concrete instantiation surface.

All existing boundaries remain unchanged:
R_OBJECT = DECLARED (R : Dom(R) → ℝ)
R_ASSEMBLY = OPEN（门时点记录；已由 R-ASSEMBLY Transition Audit 关闭为 CLOSED）
R_ORACLE = NOT_DEFINED
Δ = BLOCKED
FinLoss = NOT LEGALLY AVAILABLE
NECT = BLOCKED
STEP⑤ = NOT ENTERED
STEP⑥ = NOT ENTERED
EXPERIMENT AUTH = NONE
HARNESS AUTH = NONE

Argmin / att / uniq remain auxiliary under RO-1.
Historical δ(I_P), any new δ optimization domain, A(P,θ), and θ-level optimization remain excluded.
No implementation, harness, data collection, profiling, measurement, or experiment authorization follows from this audit.


### R-ASSEMBLY Transition Audit — 2026-09-23

The R-ASSEMBLY OPEN state originated in R-ASSEMBLY-10 / M4 (Parameter Domain Hierarchy Declaration), whose declared semantics explicitly deferred the final R_OBJECT input hierarchy until the internal interfaces were resolved.

Audit of the M4 waiting conditions:

1. P / δ / θ types resolved: R-INTERNAL-1 / P4, R-INTERNAL-2 / δ3, R-INTERNAL-3 / θ2.
2. 𝒢_adm(P) structure resolved: R-INTERNAL-4 / G4-4.
3. L domain resolved: R-INTERNAL-5 / L5-3, R-INTERNAL-6 / E6-4, R-INTERNAL-7 / E7-B, R-INTERNAL-8 / E8-C.
4. E_θ legality / existence conditions resolved: R-INTERNAL-6 / E6-4.
5. Final R_OBJECT input hierarchy resolved: R-INTERNAL-17 / RO-1 declares R_OBJECT := R : Dom(R) → ℝ, with input hierarchy (P,θ).

Hierarchy branch closure:
- The previously deferred ((P,δ),θ) alternative is closed by RO-1 and is not a live branch.
- δ remains a decision-generation parameter in Γ(P,δ)=g; it is not an additional input level of the declared R_OBJECT.

R-ASSEMBLY-1A through R-ASSEMBLY-10 were reviewed for unresolved final-object deferrals. No other explicit final-object input-hierarchy deferral remains outstanding; the identified OPEN state is the M4 deferral audited here.

Decision:
- The M4 waiting conditions are satisfied.
- The reason for R_ASSEMBLY = OPEN has expired.
- R_ASSEMBLY is therefore CLOSED at the current declared object hierarchy:
  R_OBJECT = R : Dom(R) → ℝ, with input (P,θ).

This audit does not introduce a new semantic object, does not reopen R-INTERNAL, and does not enter STEP⑤/STEP⑥.

Post-audit routing:
- R-INTERNAL chain remains IDLE.
- Concrete instantiation is the leading candidate for the next research surface.
- Consumer-driven structural declaration remains conditional on a concrete consumer need.
- Program-level questions (including STEP⑤) remain a separate route and are not entered by this audit.

The following remain unchanged:
R_OBJECT = DECLARED
R_ORACLE = NOT_DEFINED
Δ = BLOCKED
FinLoss = NOT LEGALLY AVAILABLE
NECT = BLOCKED
STEP⑤ = NOT ENTERED
STEP⑥ = NOT ENTERED
EXPERIMENT AUTH = NONE
HARNESS AUTH = NONE

No gap/D, oracle interface, historical δ(I_P), new δ optimization domain, A(P,θ), θ-level optimization, selector/tie-breaking, topology, compactness, continuity, measurability, or implementation/harness/data/measurement/experiment authorization is introduced.


### Concrete Instantiation — P0 / θ0′ — 2026-09-23

Concrete Instantiation gate is REGISTERED after final R1 semantic ratification and Final Registration Audit.

Registered instance: P0 := π0 : S → B0 with S=S1×…×S5, b=(KV headroom, |resident sessions|, execution phase), and I_P0=σ(π0). θ0′ maps to the point measure on the deterministic exogenous A/B-alternating workload of K=8 rounds with L_A=512, D_A=256, L_B=1024, D_B=128, FIFO handling, and horizon settlement.

Action set: A={serve,defer,reject}; evict-LRU is an execution mechanism under serve.

Parameters: κ=128 KiB/token, L_A=512, D_A=256, L_B=1024, D_B=128, K=8, B=192 MiB, λ=1280 token-equivalent.

KV maxima: KVAmax=96 MiB and KVBmax=144 MiB, with 144≤192<240=96+144; both directions have forced eviction at the stated maxima.

𝒢_adm(P0) is the R-ASM-E composite predicate (I_P0 visibility + trajectory feasibility). C_LOSS remains a per-trajectory scalar and L=E_μ[C_LOSS] is the sole expectation layer.

Ratified terminal settlement: v2^g(t;W)=1 for a_t=reject and t<K; v2^g(K;W)=𝟙[a_K=reject]+|Q_{K+1}^g(W)|, where Q_{K+1} contains all unresolved FIFO requests after K. Settlement is accounting only; no K+1 runtime event exists.

Finite bound: 0≤C_LOSS≤8192+10240=18432<∞, hence V(P0,θ0′)⊆[0,18432] and inf V(P0,θ0′)∈R. Registered instance fact: (P0,θ0′)∈Dom(R).

Non-degeneracy audit: always-serve-with-evict=6144; retain-A/reject-B=5632. This establishes distinct attainable values only; it does not assert att, Argmin non-emptiness, or uniq.

Explicitly not asserted: att, Argmin≠∅, uniq, selector/tie-breaking/canonical optimizer/g*, R_ORACLE, Δ/gap, FinLoss, NECT, historical δ(I_P), new δ optimization, θ-level optimization, A(P,θ), or implementation/harness/data/measurement/experiment authorization.

R-INTERNAL chain remains IDLE; R-ASSEMBLY remains CLOSED; STEP⑤/STEP⑥ remain NOT ENTERED.

Gate history: docs/07-history/R_CONCRETE_INSTANTIATION_P0_THETA0_20260923.md.

### Concrete Instance Facts — P0 / θ0′ — 2026-09-23

Post-gate computational facts derived from the registered instance (no new semantic object; R-INTERNAL remains IDLE; R_ASSEMBLY remains CLOSED):

R(P0,θ0′) = 5376.

att(P0,θ0′) = true; Argmin(P0,θ0′) ≠ ∅; realized optimal action-sequence count = 4; uniq(P0,θ0′) = false.

Derivation: the admissible action-sequence space is finite (3^8 = 6561) and the point-mass regime makes V(P0,θ0′) a finite non-empty set of reals, so inf V ∈ V (K4-A); Argmin ≠ ∅ follows by the K4-B bridge; exhaustive enumeration cross-verified by an independent per-round DP gives min = 5376; the realized minimizer family has the closed form "single residency switch to B at the k-th B-round, k ∈ {2,4,6,8}", cost 512 + 1024 + 3×1280 independent of k, hence the realized action-sequence minimizer count is 4 and uniq = false (K4-C). The post-audit scopes that count to the realized layer; rule-level exact cardinality remains OPEN.

Boundary: no selector, canonical optimizer, or g* (uniq = false independently blocks canonical selection); R_ORACLE remains NOT_DEFINED; Δ/gap remain blocked; STEP⑤/STEP⑥ remain NOT ENTERED; no implementation, harness, measurement, or experiment authorization.

Gate history: docs/07-history/R_CONCRETE_INSTANCE_FACTS_20260923.md.

### Concrete Instance Post-Audit — 2026-09-23

Post-audit scope correction: exhaustive enumeration and independent DP reconfirm
`R(P0,θ0′)=5376`, `att(P0,θ0′)=true`, and `uniq(P0,θ0′)=false`. The value `4` is
exact for realized optimal action sequences, but is not yet established as the
exact abstract rule-level cardinality because no quotient or restriction equating
visible-history rule extensions that agree on the point-mass workload has been
registered.

Current rigorous rule-level facts are:

```
R(P0,θ0′) = 5376
att(P0,θ0′) = true
uniq(P0,θ0′) = false
|Argmin(P0,θ0′)| ≥ 4
rule-level |Argmin(P0,θ0′)| = OPEN
```

`D_opt(P0,θ0′)` remains non-empty and `(P0,θ0′)∈Dom(R)`.

### Concrete Representation Decision — 2026-09-23

For `(P0,θ0′)`, the researcher selected:

```
Concrete representation = 3 / FULL_VISIBLE_HISTORY_RULE_SPACE
```

Accordingly, no realization quotient and no realized-history restriction are
introduced. The existing rule-level `Argmin / att / uniq` interfaces remain
unchanged. The four optimal realized action sequences imply only the lower
bound `|Argmin(P0,θ0′)|≥4`; exact rule-level cardinality remains OPEN.

The next concrete surface is to determine whether the full visible-history rule
representation and current declarations determine `|Argmin(P0,θ0′)|`, or formally
show underdetermination from unconstrained rule behavior on unrealized visible
histories.

Decision history:
docs/07-history/R_CONCRETE_REPRESENTATION_DECISION_20260923.md.

### Concrete Argmin Cardinality Audit — 2026-09-23

Under `FULL_VISIBLE_HISTORY_RULE_SPACE`, the point-mass instance does not
uniquely determine `|Argmin(P0,θ0′)|`. The key extension lemma is: if two
visible-history rules agree on the realized trace under `W0`, then they have
the same loss and the same fixed-instance admissibility; therefore distinct
assignments on unrealized visible histories can produce distinct rule-level
minimizers without changing realized action sequences.

Current audit result:

```
R(P0,θ0′) = 5376
att(P0,θ0′) = true
uniq(P0,θ0′) = false
realized optimal action-sequence count = 4
|Argmin(P0,θ0′)| ≥ 4
exact |Argmin(P0,θ0′)| = UNDERDETERMINED_BY_CURRENT_DECLARATIONS
```

The value `4` remains exact only for realized optimal action sequences. An
exact rule-level value would require a separate visible-history domain and
off-trajectory admissibility declaration.

Audit history:
docs/07-history/R_CONCRETE_ARGMIN_CARDINALITY_AUDIT_20260923.md.

### Concrete Argmin Cardinality Policy — 2026-09-23

The researcher selected:

```
Concrete Argmin Cardinality Policy
  = ACCEPT_UNDERDETERMINATION / NO_RULE_DOMAIN_COMPLETION_NOW
```

The exact rule-level cardinality remains underdetermined and is not treated as a
defect requiring immediate repair. The registered facts remain:

```
R(P0,θ0′) = 5376
att(P0,θ0′) = true
uniq(P0,θ0′) = false
realized optimal action-sequence count = 4
|Argmin(P0,θ0′)| ≥ 4
exact |Argmin(P0,θ0′)| = UNDERDETERMINED_BY_CURRENT_DECLARATIONS
```

No visible-history domain completion, realization quotient, selector, canonical
optimizer, or tie-breaking rule is introduced. R-INTERNAL remains IDLE,
R_ASSEMBLY remains CLOSED, and STEP⑤/STEP⑥ remain NOT ENTERED.

### Research Road Space — 2026-09-23

After accepting the concrete argmin-cardinality underdetermination, five legal
research roads are registered, but no route is selected:

```
SELECTED_ROUTE = NONE
```

1. `RULE_DOMAIN_COMPLETION` — complete the visible-history/rule object; direct
   route to exact rule-level `|Argmin|`, but deliberately not entered.
2. `INSTANCE_FAMILY` — declare a family `(P,θ)` and study variation, landscape,
   or sensitivity properties of `R`; no family is declared.
3. `SINGLE_INSTANCE_IDENTIFIABILITY` — declare observation semantics and
   behavioral equivalence before asking what one instance identifies; not
   entered.
4. `MULTI_INSTANCE_IDENTIFICATION` — study when an instance family separates
   rules; depends on prior observation/equivalence and family-index decisions;
   not entered.
5. `COMPUTATIONAL_SEMANTICS` — connect stable formal objects to executable
   semantics; deferred and non-implementative.

This is a navigation record only. It declares no semantic object, no quotient,
no family, no observation semantics, no software interface, and no experiment.
